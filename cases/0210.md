notes:
- "One more confirmed case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been discharged from hospital today", but no case numbers provided
- "Contact tracing is underway for the other eight locally transmitted cases" - we have 9 local components, hence one of the unnumbered discharged must have been a local unlinked case.
