notes:
- "Two more confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospital today", but no case numbers provided
- even though 67 is linked to 61, the first (smallest) number of the component is used for the link, in order to simplify things. This might break things when the smallest number of a component get discharged, but we'll just take the smallest (presumed) active number of a component then
